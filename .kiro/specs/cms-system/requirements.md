# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS) for the MYCOgenesis website. The CMS will enable administrators to manage blog posts, product information, user content, and other dynamic website content without requiring technical knowledge. The system integrates seamlessly with the existing website structure and Firebase authentication, maintaining the current design aesthetic while adding powerful content management capabilities.

**Integration Foundation**: The CMS is built as a unified system with the main website, sharing Firebase configuration, authentication database, and security rules while maintaining clear separation of concerns between customer-facing and administrative interfaces.
